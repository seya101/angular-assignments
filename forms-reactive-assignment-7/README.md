# Assignment #7: Reactive Form

<div>
<p>Create a Form with the following Controls and Validators</p>
<ul>
<li>Project Name (should not be empty)</li>
<li>Mail (should not be a empty and a valid email)</li>
<li>Project Status Dropdown, with three values: 'Stable', 'Critical', 'Finished'</li>
<li>Submit Button</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>
<p>Add your own Validator which doesn't allow "Test" as a Project Name</p>
<p>Also implement that Validator as an async Validator (replace the other one)</p>
<p>Upon submitting the form, simply print the value to the console</p>
</div>
